# 🧪 IAM Labs – Hands-On AWS Identity & Access Management

This repository tracks my hands-on journey through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) as part of my cloud security learning plan.

## 🔐 Labs Completed

| Lab | Title | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| ✅ 1 | [IAM Users, Groups, and Policies](labs/aws-iam-users-groups-policies.md) | Created `labuser1`, added to `LabAdmins` group, and attached `AdministratorAccess` |
| ✅ 2 | [IAM Roles and EC2 Permissions](labs/aws-iam-roles-ec2.md) | Created roles, assigned EC2 permissions, and tested with instance profile |
| ✅ 3 | [Policy Simulator & Permissions Boundaries](labs/aws-iam-policy-simulator-boundaries.md) | Tested policies using IAM Policy Simulator and added permission boundaries |

## 📌 Goal

To build a strong foundation in IAM through hands-on AWS labs and grow toward a role in cloud security. Each lab is designed, tested, and documented by me.
## 🤖 AI Integration (OCI)

Incorporating Oracle OCI AI Foundations into hands-on labs to demonstrate how AI can enrich security telemetry and speed triage. Artifacts include module notes, a mock pipeline sketch (ingest → detect → enrich), and sample outputs showing how AI-prioritized alerts can reduce analyst MTTR.
