# IAM-Labs  
Hands-on AWS IAM labs and learning tracker (5-month cloud security journey)

Welcome to my IAM Lab Tracker — a personal hands-on journey into cloud security with a focus on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). This repo documents my progress, labs, lessons, and milestones over a 5-month learning plan.

## 🧪 Lab Format

Each lab includes:
- Goal / Objective
- Tools & services used
- Step-by-step implementation
- Errors & troubleshooting (if any)
