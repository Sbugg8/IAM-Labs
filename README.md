# 🧪 IAM Labs – Hands-On AWS Identity & Access Management

This repository tracks my hands-on journey through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) as part of my cloud security learning plan.

## ⚠️ **Work in progress — study repo.**  
> This repo documents hands-on learning and contains drafts and experiments. Some lab pages are in progress — I’m actively updating artifacts. Completed, verified work will be placed in `completed/` when ready.


## 🔐 Labs (status)

| Lab | Title | Status | Notes |
|-----|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | [IAM Users, Groups, and Policies](labs/aws-iam-users-groups-policies.md) | In progress | Created `labuser1` and `LabAdmins` group (draft notes). |

## 📌 Goal

To build a strong foundation in IAM through hands-on AWS labs and grow toward a role in cloud security. Each lab is designed, tested, and documented by me.
## 🤖 AI Integration (OCI)

Incorporating Oracle OCI AI Foundations into hands-on labs to demonstrate how AI can enrich security telemetry and speed triage. Artifacts include module notes, a mock pipeline sketch (ingest → detect → enrich), and sample outputs showing how AI-prioritized alerts can reduce analyst MTTR.
