# 🧪 IAM Labs – Hands-On AWS Identity & Access Management

This repository tracks my hands-on journey through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) as part of my cloud security learning plan.

## ⚠️ **Work in progress — study repo.**  
> This repo documents hands-on learning and contains drafts and experiments. Some lab pages are in progress — I’m actively updating artifacts. Completed, verified work will be placed in `completed/` when ready.


## 🔐 Labs (Status)

| # | Lab Title | Status | Notes |
|:-:|------------|:-------:|-------|
| 1 | [IAM Users, Groups, and Policies](labs/aws-iam-users-groups-policies.md) | ✅ Completed | Created `shaynaaws1` (admin) and `lab-tester` (read-only) to demonstrate least-privilege enforcement. |
| 2 | [IAM Roles and EC2 Permissions](labs/aws-iam-roles-ec2-permissions.md) | 🧩 Draft | Role creation and EC2 permission testing pending. |
| 3 | [Policy Simulator & Permission Boundaries](labs/aws-policy-simulator-boundaries.md) | 🧩 Draft | Planning policy tests and boundary validation. |

### 🧠 AWS Identity & Access Management Labs
Hands-on IAM experiments built to demonstrate real-world access control concepts.

- [IAM Users, Groups, and Policies](labs/aws-iam-users-groups-policies.md) — Created admin and read-only users to validate AWS managed policy behavior (`ReadOnlyAccess`).
- Upcoming: Role delegation, EC2 instance profiles, and permission boundary labs.

## 📌 Goal

To build a strong foundation in IAM through hands-on AWS labs and grow toward a role in cloud security. Each lab is designed, tested, and documented by me.
## 🤖 AI Integration (OCI)

Incorporating Oracle OCI AI Foundations into hands-on labs to demonstrate how AI can enrich security telemetry and speed triage. Artifacts include module notes, a mock pipeline sketch (ingest → detect → enrich), and sample outputs showing how AI-prioritized alerts can reduce analyst MTTR.
